Every year preventable forest fires cause billions of dollar damage to property and unmeasurable loss of human life around the globe. With almost real time satellite data from NASA and other govt. spcae agencies, we can create a map of existing fires and flash-point areas. Where predictive tools can be constructed by utilizing data like humidity, temperature, terrain along with machine learning. These tools can guide towards better application of limited state resources to manage fires and to prevent them in advance.
At this crucial juncture of global climate change it's imperative that we dedicate resources towards saving existing natural resources and stop carbon build up in the atmosphere due to forest fires.
